# Block_Game
This is a project that I completed at a final for my CIS403_Object_Oriented_Programming class at Clarion University.
The purpose of Block_Game is to create a pannel were random squares are generated, and the users avoids collisions by manuevering around them for as long as possible. The longer the user stays alive, the higher they score.

I built this project using Java in Intelli J IDE. I ran it with Java 16 SDK.
